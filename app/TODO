# Important
  - Read config from a file
  - Add config file location as a command line argument
  - Maximum accepted torrents in scrape request?
  - Enable exiting using C-c, make socket reading work in subthreads as well

# Less important
  - Add QuickCheck tests
  - Use utils for all AppM reader access operations (see announce handler)
  - Does the scrape response return peer stats in the same order as the info
    hashes were received?
  - Is the name of the "State" type misleading?
  - Handle word/int size protocol discrepancies (does anything really need to
    be done?)
